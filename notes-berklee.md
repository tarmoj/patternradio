##Some thoughts/concerns/suggestions


- it would be nice to have more than six notes in the pattern

- I wanted to know right away how to remove my previous patterns from the
queue.  (Would be nice if one could)

- it would be nice to choose from a set of timbres and associate that
choice with my timbre

- difficult to differentiate (sometimes) between the low, middle and high
player - (especially the LOW pattern.  These should probably be BASS sounds
of some sort)

- might be nice to have some sort of "percussion/drum" part or track.
Maybe this isn't something that is programmed by the user, but rather
something that you create and permutate to have the whole piece/jam ride on
it.

- what about polyphony in the pattern. - meaning I can select more than one
square in a column.

- what about tonality?  We have been jamming for 20 minutes or so and most
of us are at this point yearning for an Adele track.  :-}  Just kidding,
but it would be nice to "modulate" or make a timeframe where things were in
one key or mode and then another or more tonal and more atonal or
chromatic.  Maybe allow the users to select modes even.

- what about silence?  (of a part - not just a note in the pattern)

- what about phrases?

- I do like when things seem to slow down because the mood seems to change,
but it never stays slow for long (perhaps because of your heart rate)

- more on MODES.... since you might allow the user to assign a mode before
submission, you might have the queueLIST go into MODE MODE and pop all the
patterns in the same mode up on the list.

- we are thinking it might be nice to adjust the mix locally.  SO that we
could bring up or solo individual queues at our end.

- in Russia, you had a more visual display on the screen of who was playing
what part and what their pattern was.  I found this more engaging and
intuitive, as one could watch and listen to the pattern at the same time.

- NOTE: we don't think that "start repetition after X amount of squares" is
working correctly - or we don't understand it.

- it might be nice to "retire" a pattern after a certain number of
appearances.  Maybe have an option "keep pattern alive for X cycles of the
queue" and "keep the pattern alive always"

- maybe you should think about having some some of scaling curve for the
heart rate so that on our end small changes in your heart rate could result
in more dramatic changes of tempo.  (or have some options - different
curves that we could apply.)

INTERFACE SUMMARY

(some apply when you are running this from your home or you are the "master
mixer/conductor" some options would be local and not "global")

+ choses a new timbre for low, med, high (from several presets)
+ solo/mute low, med, high
+ adjust volume of low, med, high
+ visually display the pattern of low, med, high
+ choose a mode for ALL
+ choose RANDOM (of above) for ALL
+ remove pattern from queue (MUTE this or that pattern)
+ MUTE ALL PATTERNS
+ RESELECT ONE or MULTIPLE pattern
